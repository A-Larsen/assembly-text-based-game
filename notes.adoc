== Determining string length of user input
I think I need to fill `buffer` with zeros first and then determine its
length after the read syscall

== Saving data?
Maybe just save to raw binary file and read it later

== Writing to a file?
open file wiht sys_open. write to file descriptor with sys_write?

== Stack frame
 I thinking pushing sometimes causes segfaults because it unaligns the stack,
 making it not 16-byte aligned. It seems that is the case, doing another push
 seems to realign the stack
